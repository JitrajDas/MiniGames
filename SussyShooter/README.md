The SussyShooter code implements a simple 2D shooting game in Java using the Swing framework, where a player controls a spaceship shooting at moving "troll face" enemies. Here’s a breakdown of the components:

Imported Packages
java.awt.*: Provides classes for creating user interface components like buttons, windows, etc. Graphics and Image are used for drawing 2D shapes and handling images.
java.awt.event.*: Provides interfaces and classes for event handling (e.g., user input via keyboard or mouse). Specifically, the code uses ActionListener for handling timed events and KeyListener for detecting keyboard input.
java.util.ArrayList: A resizable array implementation to hold collections like bullets or troll faces.
java.util.Random: Used for generating random numbers (to choose random images for troll faces).
javax.swing.*: Provides the Swing GUI components. The class uses JPanel as the game screen and Timer for controlling the game loop.
Classes and Variables
Block class: Represents different game objects (like the spaceship, troll faces, and bullets).

Variables:
x, y: Position of the block.
width, height: Size of the block.
img: The image of the block.
alive: Used to track if the troll face is still alive.
used: Tracks if a bullet has been used (hit a troll face).
Constructor: Initializes a block with position, size, and an image.
Game Board:

tileSize: The size of each grid tile on the board (32 pixels).
rows, columns: The number of rows and columns in the game board.
boardWidth, boardHeight: The overall size of the game board.
Images:

shipImg: The image of the player's spaceship.
tf, tfb, tfg, tfy: Images for the troll faces, stored in the tfImgArray list.
Ship Variables:

swidth, sheight: Dimensions of the spaceship.
sx, sy: Initial position of the spaceship.
svelocityX: Speed at which the ship moves left or right.
Troll Face Variables:

trollfaceArray: Holds the list of troll face blocks.
tfWidth, tfHeight: Dimensions of the troll faces.
tfX, tfY: Starting position for the troll faces.
tfRows, tfColumns: Number of rows and columns of troll faces.
tfCount: Tracks how many troll faces are still alive.
tfVelocityX: Speed at which the troll faces move horizontally.
Bullet Variables:

bulletArray: Holds the list of bullet blocks.
bulletWidth, bulletHeight: Size of each bullet.
bulletVelocityY: Speed at which the bullet moves vertically.
Game Variables:

ship: Represents the player’s spaceship as a Block.
gameLoop: A Timer that drives the game loop, calling the actionPerformed() method every frame.
gameOver: Boolean flag indicating if the game has ended.
score, highScore: Tracks the player's current score and the highest score achieved.
Methods
SussyShooter() (Constructor): Initializes the game, sets up the board dimensions, images, and starts the game loop. It also adds keyboard controls and creates the initial set of troll faces.

paintComponent(Graphics g): Custom drawing function for rendering the game screen. It calls draw() to paint the spaceship, troll faces, bullets, and score.

draw(Graphics g): Handles drawing:

The spaceship.
Troll faces (only if they are "alive").
Bullets.
The player's score.
move(): Updates the game state in every frame:

Moves troll faces and handles their collisions with the edges of the board (changing direction and moving them downwards).
Moves bullets and checks for collisions with troll faces (updates score and removes dead enemies).
Clears off-screen bullets and transitions to the next level if all troll faces are destroyed.
createTrollface(): Creates a grid of troll face blocks based on the current number of rows and columns, assigning them random images from tfImgArray.

detectCollision(Block a, Block b): Checks if two Block objects (such as bullets and troll faces) collide.

actionPerformed(ActionEvent e): Main game loop method called by the Timer. It moves the game objects, repaints the screen, and handles the game-over condition.

KeyListener Methods:

keyPressed(KeyEvent e): Handles keyboard input:
Left/Right arrow keys or A/D keys move the ship left or right.
Spacebar fires a bullet.
keyReleased(KeyEvent e): If the game is over, any key press restarts the game.
keyTyped(KeyEvent e): Empty method, as it's not needed here.
Summary
This code implements the game logic for a simple shooting game, including enemy movement, bullet firing, collision detection, and game progression. The use of Timer, KeyListener, and custom painting with Graphics allows for smooth, interactive gameplay.
